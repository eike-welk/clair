Clair
##############################################

Clair is a project to collect prices on E-Commerce sites, and display them in graphical form. 
It is aimed at used goods, that are not labeled with product IDs, but that are described with natural languages. 
Product recognition is semi automatic and uses natural language processing. 

The software is currently in an alpha stage, with no components usable for end users.

Clair is named after Wesley Clair Mitchell, an important US economist, 
who mainly worked empirically and collected a big database of prices.
Mitchell also believed that markets need to be regulated, 
and was influential in creating the New Deal.

Clair is written in the Python programming language.
