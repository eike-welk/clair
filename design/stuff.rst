Online Price Discovery Project


Project Name
============

Find nice name for the project. It is currently named `Clair` after Wesley
Clair Mitchell. Here are some other ideas:

* Price Charts
    Maybe good name for the price chart program.
* Price History
* Second Hand Market Helper
* Used Goods Price Helper
* Price Data Explorer
* Online Price Collector
* Online Trade Explorer
* Online Price Discovery Project
* Econometrics for Used Goods
* Online Econometrics
* $Name of person who was famous in area of econometrics/used goods/sustainable development
    * Arthur Hanau
        First description of pork cycles.
    * Ragnar Frisch
        Founded discipline of econometrics
    * Joseph Schumpeter
        Important economist, and econometrist. Also sympathetic figure. 
    * Frank William Taussig
        Founder of modern trade theory. Also somewhat sympathetic figure. 
        Seems less important than many others in the list, so using his name
        will probably anger no one.
    * Wesley Clair Mitchell
        Important economist, worked empirically on business cycles.
        Believed strongly that markets need to be regulated.
